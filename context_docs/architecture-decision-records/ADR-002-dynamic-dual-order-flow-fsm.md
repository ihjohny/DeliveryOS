# ADR-002: Dynamic Dual Order Dispatch Finite State Machine (`RIDER_FIRST` vs `VENDOR_FIRST`)

## Status
**Accepted** (2026-09-19)

---

## Context & Problem Statement
Hyperlocal logistics requires divergent fulfillment sequences based on merchant category:
1. **Restaurants (Hot Food)**: If cooking begins before securing a courier, food turns cold during dispatch delays, resulting in food waste and refunds.
2. **Groceries & Retail**: Products must be picked, packed, and verified on shelves before summoning a courier to avoid idle wait times.

Hardcoding a single flow or attempting concurrent "parallel" dispatch introduces race conditions and cancellation deadlocks. A deterministic finite state machine (FSM) is required that switches modes dynamically via configuration.

---

## Decision Drivers
- **Zero Food Waste**: Prevent prepared meals from sitting uncollected.
- **Courier Efficiency**: Minimize courier dwell time inside retail outlets.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Allow runtime switching via `system_settings` without restarting services.
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Eliminate parallel state synchronization deadlocks.

---

## Considered Options
1. **Fixed Vendor-First Only**: Always cook first. *(Rejected: Causes food waste when couriers are unavailable)*.
2. **Fixed Rider-First Only**: Always dispatch courier first. *(Rejected: Causes excessive courier wait times in retail/grocery)*.
3. **Tri-State Parallel Dispatch**: Broadcast to couriers and kitchen simultaneously. *(Rejected: High concurrency conflicts upon cancellation)*.
4. **Configurable Sequential Dual Mode (Chosen)**: Two strictly validated sequential FSM paths toggled dynamically.

---

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: **Configurable Sequential Dual Mode (`OrderFlowMode`)**.

        B6 --> B7["Status: DISPATCHED - Handover"]
        B7 --> B8["Status: DELIVERED"]
    end
```

### Positive Consequences
- **Food Quality Preservation**: Kitchens only cook once a courier is physically confirmed and en route.
- **Instant Mode Switching**: Admins switch fulfillment logic dynamically via `PATCH /admin/settings`.
- **Zero Race Conditions**: Clean sequential transitions eliminate overlapping assignment states.

### Negative Consequences & Mitigations
- *Trade-off*: In `RIDER_FIRST`, if rider search takes 60–90 seconds, kitchen acceptance appears delayed to the customer.
- *Mitigation*: Customer app displays explicit "Matching nearby delivery partner" progress indicator.

## Technical Implementation Details
- Central state machine and transition table implemented in [`order-state.machine.ts`](file:///Users/bs0650/BS-23-Pro/DeliveryOS/services/backend_api/src/modules/orders/order-state.machine.ts) with `assertTransition(from, to)` and `assertClaimable(order, mode)`.
- Mode claimability rules: `RIDER_FIRST` claims from `PLACED`; `VENDOR_FIRST` claims from `READY_FOR_PICKUP`.
- Invariant A3 Security Guard: Rider claiming and delivery strictly requires `order.riderId === rider.id`, completely eliminating unassigned order cash collection holes.
- Rider trip ledger records exact `delivery_economics.rider_share_percent` (80%) of delivery fee, maintaining 100% financial consistency across ledger entries and WebSocket broadcasts.
- Stored in `system_settings` table under `order_flow_config`:
  ```json
  {
    "mode": "RIDER_FIRST",
    "rider_search_timeout_seconds": 90
  }
  ```
- Cached in Redis for sub-millisecond retrieval during checkout processing.

## Order Cancellation, Vendor Rejection & Refund Flow

### Cancellation State Transitions
- **Customer Cancellation**: Permitted strictly while status is `PLACED` or `RIDER_ASSIGNED`. Once an order enters `PREPARING` or later, customer self-cancellation is strictly forbidden (throws HTTP 400 Bad Request) to protect vendor cooking investments.
- **Vendor Rejection**: Permitted prior to cooking initiation with structured reason codes (`OUT_OF_STOCK`, `KITCHEN_OVERLOAD`, `STORE_CLOSING_SOON`, `OTHER`).
- **Super Admin Force-Cancellation**: Permitted prior to `DISPATCHED` with mandatory audit reason.

### Atomic Rollback & Financial Reversal Invariants
When an order is cancelled:
1. **FSM Transition**: Status transitions to `CANCELLED` and `cancelledAt` / `rejectionReason` are recorded.
2. **Payment Reversal**: If `paymentStatus === PAID`, payment status updates to `REFUNDED`; if `PENDING`, updates to `FAILED`.
3. **Coupon Restoral**: If `couponId` is present, `Coupon.currentUses` is atomically decremented by 1.
4. **Ledger Purge**: Pending `CommissionLedger` and `RiderTripLedger` records are atomically deleted to eliminate accidental settlement payouts.
5. **Courier Lock Release**: Active Redis keys `rider:active_order:${riderId}` and `lock:order_claim:${orderId}` are removed to restore courier availability.
6. **Real-time Push**: Emits `order:cancelled` and `order:status:changed` (newStatus `CANCELLED`) to rooms and dispatches FCM notifications.

## Compliance & Verification
- Integration verification: [`test-order-dispatch-fsm.ts`](file:///Users/bs0650/BS-23-Pro/DeliveryOS/services/backend_api/scripts/test-order-dispatch-fsm.ts) validates runtime switching and concurrent claims.
- Fulfillment verification: [`test-vendor-rider.ts`](file:///Users/bs0650/BS-23-Pro/DeliveryOS/services/backend_api/scripts/test-vendor-rider.ts) and [`test-e2e-lifecycle.ts`](file:///Users/bs0650/BS-23-Pro/DeliveryOS/services/backend_api/scripts/test-e2e-lifecycle.ts) validate full lifecycle progression and penny-perfect financial balancing.
- Cancellation verification: [`test-order-cancellation.ts`](file:///Users/bs0650/BS-23-Pro/DeliveryOS/services/backend_api/scripts/test-order-cancellation.ts) validates all 4 boundary conditions: customer cancel, pre-prep boundary guard, vendor rejection, and admin force-cancel with refund.

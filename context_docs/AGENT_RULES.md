## 2. Non-Negotiable Core Business Invariants

When generating code, you must strictly uphold these inviolable business rules:

1. **Master Super Admin Authority**:
   - The Super Admin has 100% centralized authority. All endpoints must allow a `SUPER_ADMIN` to create, edit, price-override, or disable any vendor's catalog, menu item, or operational schedule.
2. **Single-Vendor Checkout**:
   - In the MVP, a customer's cart and checkout can only contain items from **one vendor at a time**. If a user tries adding an item from a different store, the client and server must reject/confirm before clearing the previous store's cart.
3. **Dual Delivery Fee Support (Config-Driven)**:
   - The system must support two modes configured via `system_settings`:
     - **`FIXED_FLAT`**: Flat fee (e.g., 50 BDT / 12 SAR) regardless of distance within the delivery radius.
     - **`DISTANCE_TIERED`**: `Base Fee + (Distance in km * Rate per km)`.
4. **Smooth 3-Step Rider Fulfillment**:
   - Do NOT introduce complex verification PINs, barcode scans, or digital signatures for the MVP.
   - Fulfillment must strictly follow: **Step 1: Accept** → **Step 2: Pick Up Order** (one-tap) → **Step 3: Deliver Order** (one-tap + COD cash checkbox).
5. **Native Device Handoff (Zero-Cost & Low-Complexity)**:
   - Phone contact must be implemented via the native device dialer (`tel:<phone_number>`). Do NOT build complex in-app VoIP or chat for the MVP.
   - Rider routing must launch native Google Maps or Apple Maps via deep links (`google.navigation:q=lat,lng`).
6. **Smart Re-Order Validation**:
   - When a user taps "Re-order", the API **must** validate real-time item stock availability, active prices, and whether the store is currently open before populating the cart.
7. **Multi-Region & Multi-Currency**:
   - The codebase must be region-agnostic from Day 1. Currencies (`BDT`, `SAR`, `USD`), phone prefixes (`+880`, `+966`), and languages (`en`, `ar`, `bn`) must be config-driven, with first-class RTL layout support for Arabic.
8. **Configurable Order Dispatch Sequence (Rider-First vs Vendor-First)**:
   - The order fulfillment sequence must be dynamic and config-driven (`order_flow_mode` in `system_settings`):
     - **`RIDER_FIRST` (Zero Food Waste Mode)**: When customer orders, verify store status (open/items in stock) before DB write → immediately broadcast to riders → assign rider → send order to vendor for manual acceptance & prep timer selection. Prevents food waste from unassigned orders while preserving vendor control.
     - **`VENDOR_FIRST`**: Traditional flow where vendor accepts and preps first, broadcasting to riders when food is packing/ready.
     - **`PARALLEL`**: Simultaneous rider broadcast and vendor alert upon checkout.

## 3. Technology Stack & Architectural Standards

### 3.1 Backend (NestJS / TypeScript)
- **Framework**: NestJS 10.x with Node.js 20 LTS.
- **Language**: Strict TypeScript (`"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`). Never use `any`; use strongly typed DTOs, interfaces, or generics.
- **Validation**: Every incoming request must be validated with `class-validator` and `class-transformer` via a global `ValidationPipe({ whitelist: true, forbidNonWhitelisted: true, transform: true })`.
- **Response Format**: All controller endpoints must return the standardized response envelope:
  ```json
  { "success": true, "statusCode": 200, "message": "...", "data": {} }
  ```
- **Error Handling**: Use a Global Exception Filter (`AllExceptionsFilter`) to catch and transform errors into standard error envelopes with timestamps and correlation IDs.
- **Tenant Isolation**: On vendor routes, enforce `where: { vendor_id: req.user.vendorId }` unless the authenticated user has role `SUPER_ADMIN`.

### 3.2 Database & Data Integrity (PostgreSQL 16 + PostGIS)
- **ACID Transactions**: **Every** order creation, status change, and financial ledger entry **must** be executed inside an atomic database transaction (`prisma.$transaction` or TypeORM `queryRunner`).
- **Spatial Types**: Vendor coordinates and customer delivery addresses must be stored using `GEOGRAPHY(Point, 4326)`.
- **Spatial Indexing**: All spatial columns must have a `GIST` index.
- **Auditing**: Always include `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps on all persistent tables.

### 3.3 Real-Time & Caching (Redis 7 + Socket.IO 4.x)
- **Live Rider Coordinates**: Store rider GPS ticks exclusively in Redis using `GEOADD riders:locations:active <lng> <lat> <rider_id>`. Do NOT write high-frequency GPS ticks to PostgreSQL.
- **Atomic Dispatch Locking**: Order claiming must use an atomic Redis mutex (`SET lock:order_claim:<orderId> <riderId> NX EX 10`) to eliminate race conditions between competing riders.
- **Kitchen Alerts**: Order notifications sent to the vendor web portal (`order:new`) must trigger a persistent, looping audio chime until acknowledged.

### 3.4 Web Portal (React.js SPA with Vite)
- **Stack**: Vite + React 18+ + TailwindCSS + TanStack Query + Zustand.
- **Zero SSR**: Pure client-side Single Page Application. Static build deployed via Nginx / Cloudflare Pages.
- **Role Guards**: Route guards (`<RoleGuard allowedRoles={[...]} />`) separating `/admin/*` and `/vendor/*`.
- **Audio Unlock**: Handle browser autoplay restrictions by initializing the audio context on the first user interaction.

### 3.5 Mobile Applications (Flutter 3.x)
- **Architecture**: Feature-First Clean Architecture (Presentation, Domain, Data).
- **State Management**: Riverpod 2.x (`AsyncNotifierProvider` / `StateNotifierProvider`).
- **Localization**: JSON translation dictionaries (`en.json`, `ar.json`, `bn.json`) with auto-mirroring RTL directionality for Arabic.
- **Battery Preservation**: Throttled GPS beaconing (every 5–8 seconds only when rider status is `Online`).

## 4. Step-by-Step Implementation Procedure for AI Agents

When tasked with generating or modifying code, execute in this exact sequence:

```
[ STEP 1: CONTEXT ] ──► [ STEP 2: SCHEMA ] ──► [ STEP 3: BACKEND API ]
                                                        │
[ STEP 6: VERIFY  ] ◄── [ STEP 5: FRONTEND ] ◄── [ STEP 4: REALTIME ]
```

1. **Step 1: Context Verification**:
   - Read the relevant BRD and TID files in `context_docs/`. Identify all entity relationships, constraints, and side effects.
2. **Step 2: Database Migrations**:
   - Update Prisma schema or SQL migration files first. Ensure spatial types and indexes are declared. Run migrations.
3. **Step 3: Backend Core & DTOs**:
   - Define strictly typed DTOs with validation decorators.
   - Implement service logic with atomic transactions.
   - Expose REST controller endpoints adhering to the standard envelope.
4. **Step 4: Real-Time WebSockets & Redis**:
   - Wire Socket.IO gateway events and rooms.
   - Integrate Redis keys, TTLs, and pub/sub adapters.
5. **Step 5: Frontend & Mobile Implementation**:
   - Implement UI components adhering to responsive mobile/tablet design.
   - Bind API queries using TanStack Query or Riverpod.
   - Implement audio alerts and native dialer / map launch handlers.
6. **Step 6: Rigorous Verification**:
   - Verify TypeScript compilation without errors.
   - Test edge cases (e.g., out-of-stock items, concurrent order claims, invalid phone formats).

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist

Before marking any engineering task as complete, verify that:
- [ ] Code compiles with **zero errors** and **zero warnings** in strict mode.
- [ ] All inputs are strictly sanitized and validated (no SQL injection, no parameter pollution).
- [ ] Database transactions wrap all multi-step financial or order updates.
- [ ] Error messages are clear, human-understandable, and do not leak internal stack traces to clients.
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or API keys exist in the source code (use `.env`).
- [ ] The implementation aligns 100% with the requirements in `context_docs/`.

---

## 6. Git & Version Control Protocol

1. **NO AUTO-COMMITS**:
   - Never commit code automatically or autonomously.
   - You must only run `git commit` when explicitly instructed by the user.
2. **Commit Message Convention**:
   - Always adhere to **Conventional Commits**: `<type>(<scope>): <clear description in imperative mood>`.
   - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `perf`, `chore`.
   - Examples:
     - `feat(auth): implement phone OTP verification with JWT issuance`
     - `fix(dispatch): resolve Redis lock race condition on order claim`
     - `docs(api): update checkout payload schema in TID-03`

---

## 7. Zero-Assumption & Active Interview Protocol

1. **NEVER ASSUME OR GUESS**:
   - If any requirement, user prompt, architectural path, or business rule is ambiguous, unclear, or underspecified, **do NOT make assumptions or proceed based on guesses**.
2. **PROACTIVE INTERVIEWING**:
   - Immediately pause and interview the user to resolve confusion and secure the exact direction.
   - Present concise, structured choices with your recommended option clearly stated: `"(Recommended) ..."`.
   - Resolve design decisions step-by-step until mutual understanding is achieved before executing changes.
3. **CONFIRM BEFORE DESTRUCTIVE / MAJOR ACTIONS**:
   - For major architectural deviations, schema changes, or breaking refactors, explain the trade-offs and confirm explicit user alignment first.

---

## 8. Pattern Consistency & Living Documentation Protocol

1. **STRICT PATTERN & STYLE CONTINUITY**:
   - When creating or modifying code, always mirror the established project patterns:
     - Architecture layers, folder organization, and file naming conventions.
     - Coding style, type definitions, error envelopes, and state management paradigms.
     - Design tokens, Tailwind CSS utility patterns, and UI component standards.
   - Do NOT introduce rogue design styles, inconsistent conventions, or competing architectural libraries.
2. **MANDATORY CONTEXT DOC SYNCHRONIZATION (LIVING DOCS)**:
   - When an API endpoint, data model, business workflow, or UI interaction changes, you **MUST immediately update the corresponding documentation in `context_docs/`** (BRDs, TIDs, and Schemas).
   - Never allow code and documentation to drift out of sync. Documentation is the authoritative single source of truth.
3. **ENTERPRISE TEAM COLLABORATION MINDSET**:
   - Build and maintain every module as if collaborating in a large, distributed engineering team.
   - Ensure clean modular boundaries, explicit type signatures, predictable error handling, and self-documenting code to enable effortless team onboarding and long-term production resilience.

## 9. Token-Efficiency & Production Safety Protocol

To minimize AI token consumption while maximizing code correctness and preventing regressions:

1. **TARGETED CONTEXT LOADING (ZERO TOKEN WASTE)**:
   - **Never read all context documents at once.**
   - Consult `context_docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` to identify the **exact 1 or 2 files** required for your specific task:
     - *Working on Auth?* Load only `TID-03` + `TID-02 (users table)`.
     - *Working on Rider Dispatch?* Load only `TID-05` + `TID-04`.
     - *Working on Kitchen UI?* Load only `BRD-05` + `TID-04 (events)`.
2. **SURGICAL, DIFF-ORIENTED FILE EDITS**:
   - Do NOT rewrite whole multi-hundred-line files to change a single function or styling rule.
   - Use targeted line replacements to conserve input/output tokens and eliminate accidental syntax regressions.
3. **CONCISE, FLUFF-FREE COMMUNICATION**:
   - Strip conversational pleasantries and repetitive summaries from tool explanations and responses.
   - Focus directly on: What was changed, how it was verified, and key technical considerations.
4. **ZERO-REGRESSION IMPLEMENTATION**:
   - Never break existing public API interfaces, DTO fields, database foreign keys, or UI component props.
   - Extend existing types gracefully using optional properties or interface inheritance rather than destructive mutations.
